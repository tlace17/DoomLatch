# DoomLatch

## What is it?

The DoomLatch is a compact latching system for Doomified Printer for Ants. It is compact and allows for single hand operation to open and close. The idea was sparked by zarboz on the DOOMCube Discord for his PITCHFork project.

The design utilizes two magnets of like poles to create a dampened spring mechanism to keep the latch closed, since they oppose the installation requires no glue and allows the magnets to be serviceable in the case that they lose their strength over time.

Files for both a pre-supported version and an unsupported version have been provided for convenience.
